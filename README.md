# Presentation

This repository contains some notes of courses related to machine learning I have found interesting.

These notes are clearly not sufficient on their own to understand the subject matter of a course, but they help remembering key points presented during the courses. If you are interested, I recommend you to take the courses. Each document provides a link to the course to which it relates.
